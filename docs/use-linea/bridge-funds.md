# Bridge your funds

In order to transact on Linea, you'll need to bridge Goerli ETH from Goerli to Linea. The following steps take you through bridging USDC and Goerli ETH using the Hop bridge.

You can find examples of how to bridge other tokens such as BNB and MATIC by exploring some of our partner bridges under the [explore section](./explore/).

## Set up

Before you begin, ensure your wallet is:

1. [Configured to use Linea](./set-up-your-wallet.md)
1. [Funded with test tokens](./fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli)

## Bridge from Goerli to Linea

1.  [Navigate to the token bridge](https://goerli.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH&sourceNetwork=ethereum&destNetwork=linea)
1.  Make sure in the top dropdown menu, **Goerli** is selected, and in the bottom dropdown menu, **Linea** is selected.
1.  Select your desired token (**USDC** or **ETH**).
1.  Specify an amount less than your balance to send.
1.  If you are sending **USDC**, you'll need to select approve before selecting send.
1.  Select **Send**. First time users need to approve the Linea bridge to allow token transfers.
1.  In your MetaMask wallet, confirm the transfer.

The sent amount is deducted from your Goerli account on MetaMask. Switch to Linea in your wallet to view the bridged funds.
